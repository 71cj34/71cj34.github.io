         This design project was the most expansive in scope in the first-year set. Given freedom to use any means desired, we were tasked to conceptualize, design, build, and test an invention
         that will help a client in need.

         <span>The Project</span>
      </h2>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
         <strong>The Client:</strong>
         <p>
            The client, who has Usher's Syndrome affecting her vision drastically, cannot do many daily tasks we take for granted. However, her disability makes it difficult for her to do so. We
            were tasked with creating a design that would help her in some way.
         </p>
         <p>
            The team was inspired by a video she posted about her struggles cooking, and decided to the aim would be to invent something to help the Client cut food. 
            A refined problem statement was developed to lay out the aims and objectives of the design. 
         </p>
         <strong>Problem Statement:</strong>
         <p>
            Kimberly, a client who is diagnosed with Usher's Syndrome experiences hearing and vision impairments which affect her peripheral vision and induces colour-blindness. 
            Within her home she experiences significant challenges including processing and handling food items safely. The client requires a compact, lightweight, and affordable device that 
            enables her to cut food autonomously, easily and without injury.
         </p>
         <strong>Objectives/Constraints:</strong>
         <p>
            As they would be the main evaluation method for the design, objectives/constraints were created (Fig. 1).
         </p>

         </div>

         <strong>Initial Design:</strong>
            <p>
            The team conducted individual research. I researched past patents and their designs/innovations, which led to the creation of numerous initial designs.
            </p>
            <p>
            We conferred over initial designs, and we decided my initial design (Fig. 2) was best and most suited to the problem. A <strong>morph chart</strong> was created, and used to decide which
            elements were best for each objective.
         </p>

         </div>
         <strong>Designing:</strong>
         <p>
            I helped refined and improve our team's eventual 3D model (Fig. 3), using ideas and parts from my design (Fig. 4). Research and feedback from upper-year students was incorporated into 
            the design, for example:

         <ul class="markdown_list">
            <li>A spiked back wall</li>
            <li>A hinge mechanism</li>
            <li>A bracer for both movable side joints</li>
        </ul>
         <div style="display: flex; justify-content: center;">

         </div>
         
         <strong>
            Fabrication:
         </strong>
         <p>
            The design (Fig. 5) was fabricated using 3D printing and wood cutting. The parts took around <strong>22 hours</strong> to print, and I printed around <strong>10 hours</strong> of it. We assembled 
            the design using screws, nuts, and washers, using hot glue where needed.
         </p>
         <p>
            It features numerous safety and usability features, such as:
         </p>
         <ul class="markdown_list">
            <li>Extruded board to catch cut food</li>
            <li>Orange tape so the client can see where to hold</li>
            <li>Ergonormic handholds</li>
            <li>Large cutting area</li>
            <li>Modular design and dissambleable parts</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Helps with cleaning and travel</li>
               </ul>
            <li>
               Rotatable handholds for comfort
            </li>
        </ul>

         <strong>
            Testing:
         </strong>
         <p>
            Testing was done to ensure the design held up with the objectives and constraints. A testing plan was created and deployed (Fig. 6) in the days leading to the final presentation.
         </p>

            It passes all but three. Given relative importance of <strong>size</strong>, it was considered fine, and to improve <strong>usability</strong> and <strong>safety</strong>, last-minute
            changes were made. For example, rubber bumpers on the bottom were deployed to keep the design from moving while in use.
         </p>
         <strong>
            Presentation:
         </strong>
         <p>
            I wrote the <strong>entire first draft</strong> of the twenty-page project report. Afterwards, the team and I went through cleaning up my notes and revising it. A Powerpoint presentation 
            was also written. I created <strong>most of the presentation</strong>, as well as <strong>delegated speaking parts</strong>. 
         </p>

         <span class="bolder" style="text-indent: 0">ON ENGINEERING</span>
         <p>
            This project is the most thorough exploration of what engineering really is out of everything in Eng 1. Wheras in other projects like <a href="/portfolio/ds2">Project 2</a> the design processing 
            started theoretical and ended theoretical, I learned how the entire design pipeline works from conceptualization to fabrication.
         </p>
         <p>
            However, I cannot help but wonder if our design really was the best it could be. When we were deciding on what kind of design to make, we decided on a hardware solution, even though our team's strengths 
            were in software. I wonder what kind of design we would have made if we chose software. But, I also think that choosing something we were unfamiliar with is the point of the project. You learn nothing if
            you stick to what is familiar. So, I do not regret choosing hardware at all.
            </p>
            <p>
               We were short on time near the end of the project because of unforseen circumstances regarding our 3D printing and fabrication. I think that next time, we should give ourselves more time for fabrication
               and testing by shortening the time we took for design and refinements. We did most of it all in one block, when we could have instead spread it out over the whole project.

            <strong>ON TEAMWORK:</strong>
            <p>
               This was a very collaborative project. I served as the <strong>Manager</strong>, which means I delegated responsibilities, was the first point of contact to supervisors, and led group discussions.
               I think that next time, though, I would make sure to tell my teammates exactly what to do. Sometimes, I was ambiguous, and team members wasted time or resources because of it. Otherwise, this was
               my first experience 'leading' a group project. 
            </p>
            <strong>ON PRACTICAL KNOWLEDGE:</strong>
            <p>
               I learned so much about 3D printing, wood cutting, and had hands-on experience with so much machine knowledge, from small things like power drills to the larger things like band saws. I also gained an
               appreciation for accessibility and consumer-forward design principles.
            </p>
            <p>
               Also, this project let me collaborate with others using Autodesk Inventor. I used tools in the program I had never before, like <strong>contact solvers</strong>, dimensional analysis with 
               <strong>iProperties</strong>, and <strong>material simulation</strong>.
