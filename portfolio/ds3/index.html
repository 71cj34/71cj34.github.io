         This design project was the most expansive in scope in the first-year set. Given freedom to use any means desired, we were tasked to conceptualize, design, build, and test an invention
         that will help a client in need.

         <span>The Project</span>
      </h2>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
         <strong>The Client:</strong>
         <p>
            The client, who has Usher's Syndrome affecting her vision drastically, cannot do many daily tasks we take for granted. However, her disability makes it difficult for her to do so. We
            were tasked with creating a design that would help her in some way.
         </p>
         <p>
            The team was inspired by a video she posted about her struggles cooking, and decided to the aim would be to invent something to help the Client cut food. 
            A refined problem statement was developed to lay out the aims and objectives of the design. 
         </p>
         <strong>Problem Statement:</strong>
         <p>
            Kimberly, a client who is diagnosed with Usher's Syndrome experiences hearing and vision impairments which affect her peripheral vision and induces colour-blindness. 
            Within her home she experiences significant challenges including processing and handling food items safely. The client requires a compact, lightweight, and affordable device that 
            enables her to cut food autonomously, easily and without injury.
         </p>
         <strong>Objectives/Constraints:</strong>
         <p>
            As they would be the main evaluation method for the design, objectives/constraints were created (Fig. 1).
         </p>

            <p class="caption"><strong>Fig. 1:</strong> Objectives, rationale, and metric</p>
         </div>

         <strong>Initial Design:</strong>
            <p>
            The team conducted individual research. I researched past patents and their designs/innovations, which led to the creation of numerous initial designs.
            </p>
            <p>
            We conferred over initial designs, and we decided my initial design (Fig. 2) was best and most suited to the problem. A morph chart was created, and used to decide which
            elements were best for each objective.
         </p>

         </div>
         <strong>Designing:</strong>
         <p>
            I helped refined and improve our team's eventual 3D model (Fig. 3), using ideas and parts from my design (Fig. 4). Research and feedback from upper-year students was incorporated into 
            the design, for example:

         <ul class="markdown_list">
            <li>A spiked back wall</li>
            <li>A hinge mechanism</li>
            <li>A bracer for both movable side joints</li>
        </ul>

         </div>
         
         <strong>
            Fabrication:
         </strong>
         <p>
            The design (Fig. 5) was fabricated using 3D printing and wood cutting. The parts took around <strong>22 hours</strong> to print, and I printed around <strong>10 hours</strong> of it. We assembled 
            the design using screws, nuts, and washers, using hot glue where needed.
         </p>
         <p>
            It features numerous safety and usability features, such as:
         </p>
         <ul class="markdown_list">
            <li>Extruded board to catch cut food</li>
            <li>Orange tape so the client can see where to hold</li>
            <li>Ergonormic handholds</li>
            <li>Large cutting area</li>
            <li>Modular design and dissambleable parts</li>
               <ul>
                  <li>Helps with cleaning and travel</li>
               </ul>
            <li>
               Rotatable handholds for comfort
            </li>
        </ul>

         <strong>
            Testing:
         </strong>
         <p>
            Testing was done to ensure the design held up with the objectives and constraints. A testing plan was created and deployed (Fig. 6) in the days leading to the final presentation.
         </p>

            It passes all but three. Given relative importance of <strong>size</strong>, it was considered fine, and to improve <strong>usability</strong> and <strong>safety</strong>, last-minute
            changes were made. For example, rubber bumpers on the bottom were deployed to keep the design from moving while in use.
         </p>
         <strong>
            Presentation:
         </strong>
         <p>
            I wrote the entire first draft of the twenty-page project report. Afterwards, the team and I went through cleaning up my notes and revising it. A Powerpoint presentation was also written.
            I created most of the presentation, as well as delegated speaking parts.

         <span class="bolder" style="text-indent: 0">ON ENGINEERING</span>
         <p>
            This project is the most thorough exploration of what engineering really is out of everything in Eng 1. Wheras in other projects like <a href="/portfolio/ds2">Project 2</a> the design processing 
            started theoretical and ended theoretical, I learned how the entire design pipeline works from conceptualization to fabrication.
         </p>
         <p>
            However, I cannot help but wonder if our design really was the best it could be.
            </p>
            <p>
            For example, a group member volunteered to calculate an MPI by themselves, but ended up getting it wrong. 
            Although I knew how to work with MPIs, having to correct and retroactively fix the error while I should have offered to help or look over the result took time away from completing the project. I wonder if I
            was more available, could we have been able to refine our work even further? In the future, I will definitely make sure to offer my skills instead of letting others do work by themselves often.

         <p>
            There were some miscommunications, since each member was doing their own material analysis/eco-audit on their own installation of Granta EduPack. I think that we should have been more clear with our
            communication, such as putting all of our data into one source instead of having to ask one another for it. This led to incorrect propogations of data and general confusion. In the future, I will 
            make sure to remind my team to communicate.
            </p>
            <p>
            I became very familiar with the use of software like <strong>material databases</strong> (eg. Granta EduPack), <strong>project design structures</strong> (eg. morph chart, objective tree), and the derivation/use
            of engineering concepts like <strong>MPIs</strong>, <strong>constraints</strong>, and <strong>product life cycles</strong>.
