      <p>
         This design project was the most expansive in scope in the first-year set. Given freedom to use any means desired, we were tasked to conceptualize, design, build, and test an invention
         that will help a client in need.

      </h2>
      <div class="dropdown-content">
         <strong>The Client:</strong>
         <p>
            The client, who has Usher's Syndrome affecting her vision drastically, wishes to prepare and cook food independently at home. However, her disability makes it difficult for her to do so, 
            particularly when it comes to cutting food. She is seeking a device that will allow her to cut food safely, easily, and autonomously, while accommodating her visual impairments.
         </p>
         <p>
            Once the team decided to the aim would be to invent something to help the Client cut food, a refined problem statement was developed. 
         </p>
         <strong>Problem Statement:</strong>
         <p>
            Kimberly, a client who is diagnosed with Usher's Syndrome experiences hearing and vision impairments which affect her peripheral vision and induces colour-blindness. 
            Within her home she experiences significant challenges including processing and handling food items safely. The client requires a compact, lightweight, and affordable device that 
            enables her to cut food autonomously, easily and without injury.
         </p>
         <strong>Objectives/Constraints:</strong>
         <p>
            As they would be the main evaluation method for the design, objectives/constraints were created.
         </p>

            <p class="caption"><strong>Fig. 1:</strong> Objectives, rationale, and metric</p>
         </div>

         <strong>Initial Design:</strong>
            <p>
            The team conducted individual research. I researched past patents and their designs/innovations, which led to the creation of numerous initial designs.
            </p>
            <p>
            We conferred over initial designs, and we decided my initial design was best and most suited to the problem. A morph chart was created, and used to decide which
            elements were best for each objective.

            <p class="caption"><strong>Fig. 2:</strong> One of my design drawings.</p>
         </div>
         <strong>Research:</strong>
         <p>
            Research was done to find means of accomplishing the objectives. These means aimed not as much to be realistic but varied, with the goal of capturing the solution space. First, I wrote an executive research 
            summary on the current state of filtration technology fitting to our scenario, and compared with my teammates' research to come up with a morph chart (Fig. 2).
         </p>

         <p>
            Afterwards, research was done on numerous real-world concerns: potential materials, contaminant/waste standards, electricity standards, optimal placement, and other relevant regulation.
         </p>
         <p>
            Through weighing the cost of benefits of each means carefully, <strong>ozonation</strong> was judged to be the most sustainable and efficient method of filtration, 
            I researched potential material acquisition, finding pertinent information on laws on materials and wastewater for Eastern Australia.
         </p>
         <strong>
            MPIs:
         </strong>
         <p>
            MPIs were derived for the objectives. I was assigned the MPI of minimizing carbon footprint $\text{CO}_2$, while optimizing for yield strength $\sigma$. 
            Using the provided functional constraint for $\sigma_y$, the MPI was derived: 
            $$
            \begin{align*}
            m &= ALP & \sigma_y &> \frac{6FL}{bh^2} \\
            m &= bhlP & \sigma_y &> \frac{6FL}{b(\frac{m}{bLP})^2} \\
            h &= \frac{m}{bLP} & \sigma_y &> \frac{6FL}{\frac{bm^2}{b^2L^2P^2}} \\
            \text{subst}&\text{ituting } h \nearrow & \sigma_y &> \frac{6FLbL^2P^2}{m^2} \\
            && \sigma_y &> \frac{6FL^3bP^2}{m^2} \\
            && m^2 &< \frac{6FL^3bP^2}{\sigma_y} \\
            && m &< \sqrt{6FL^2}\frac{P}{\sqrt{\sigma_y}} \\
            && MPI &= \frac{\sigma_y^{1/2}}{P} = \frac{\sigma_y^{1/2}}{\rho \cdot \text{CO}_2}

            \end{align*}
            $$
         </p>
         <p>
            This MPI along with the two constraints <strong>Freshwater Durability (excellent)</strong>, <strong>Built Environments (rural)</strong>, were used in the materials database Granta EduPack to
            find the optimal materials for the project.

         <p>
            Upon comparison of my Top 3 matterials with my teammates' materials, a final Top 3 was found:
            <ul class="markdown_list">
                <li>Coir fiber</li>
                <li>Polypropylene fiber</li>
                <li>Limestone</li>
            </ul>
            
            I researched the suitability of coir fiber, particularly its availability in the area and envrionmental safety. In the end, since polypropylene fiber has strong anti-bacterial properties on its own,
            it was selected as the final material.
         </p>
         <p>
            The number of pores for our material was calculated, then the porosity of the overall fiber, then the effective Young's Modulus and yield strength for the material. 
            </p>
            <p>
            In the resultant chart (Fig. 4), 
            polypropylene satisfied the required yield strength of $154 \; \text{N} / \text{m}^2$.
         </p>
         <strong>
            Eco Audits
         </strong>
         <p>
            Finally, Granta Eco-Audits (Fig. 5) were performed to ensure the material's ecological performance was up to par.
        </p>
        <div class="img-cont right_img" style="width: 35%">

            <p class="caption"><strong>Fig. 4: </strong> The chart, showing polypropylene above the line. </p>
         </div> 
        <p>
            I created a life-cycle diagram (Fig. 6) for my assigned material of coir fiber, as well as the Eco-Audit
            for it. It confirmed that while polypropylene used the most energy, it had the most potential for recycling and use after its end of life.
         </p>
         <strong>Presentation:</strong>
         <p>
            We created a ~10-minute presentation on our process and findings, and I created, wrote, and presented the content for the slides: 
            <ul class="markdown_list">
                <li>MPI</li>
                <li>Material selection</li>
                <li>Objectives/constraints</li>
            </ul>
            

            I also wrote the content for various other slides, such as summarizing our findings on porosity and the eco-audit.
         </p>

         <p>
            I learned a lot about the design process, and how to use it in a real-world project to find the optimal solution in a quantitative and testable way.  
         </p>
         <p>
            From the <a href="/portfolio/ds1">first project</a>, I learned and applied many of the things I learned, such as team leadership, knowing when to defer to others, working efficiently with others to
            succeed, but I think I was too eager to let others do the work when they offered. 
            </p>
            <p>
            For example, a group member volunteered to calculate an MPI by themselves, but ended up getting it wrong. 
            Although I knew how to work with MPIs, having to correct and retroactively fix the error while I should have offered to help or look over the result took time away from completing the project. I wonder if I
            was more available, could we have been able to refine our work even further? In the future, I will definitely make sure to offer my skills instead of letting others do work by themselves often.

         <p>
            There were some miscommunications, since each member was doing their own material analysis/eco-audit on their own installation of Granta EduPack. I think that we should have been more clear with our
            communication, such as putting all of our data into one source instead of having to ask one another for it. This led to incorrect propogations of data and general confusion. In the future, I will 
            make sure to remind my team to communicate.
            </p>
            <p>
            I became very familiar with the use of software like <strong>material databases</strong> (eg. Granta EduPack), <strong>project design structures</strong> (eg. morph chart, objective tree), and the derivation/use
            of engineering concepts like <strong>MPIs</strong>, <strong>constraints</strong>, and <strong>product life cycles</strong>.
