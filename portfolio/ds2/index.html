      <p>
         During this group project, we found the optimal material for a filter fiber for use in a waterwater treatment facility. 
         This was done with analytical methods such as finding MPIs and developing design objectives, as well as technological methods such as material databases.

      <div class="dropdown-content">
         <strong>Problem:</strong>
         <p>
            We were given a scenario and usecase for a filter fiber for use in a wastewater system. From this scenario, we were tasked with designing a filter fiber suitable for the situation through
            <strong>technology and software</strong> like Granta EduPack.
         </p>
         <p>
            Our scenario concerned a hospital in rural Byron Bay, Australia. Local residents were concerned that the hospital's effluent contained antibiotics such as <strong>ciprofloxacin</strong>,
             which were not adequately filtered out. These antiobiotic strains could cause damage to the environment.
         </p>
         <strong>Technical Objectives:</strong>
         <p>
            A set of objectives, constraints, and other goals were compiled, using organizational structures to organize our ideas. I led talks on the creation of an objective tree, suggesting key items 
            such as <strong>modularity</strong>, <strong>weather friendliness</strong> (taking into account Australia's climate), and other restructuring, such as merging "low maintenance" and "repairable" into the same
            category. See Fig. 1.
         </p>

            <p class="caption"><strong>Fig. 1:</strong> Final objective tree used as brainstorming. </p>
         </div>
         <p>
            Finally, taking into consideration all objectives and constraints developed in the brainstorming, three were chosen: "environmentally friendly", "cost-effective", and "low/easy maintenance".
            A problem statement was created to inform the future of the project.
         </p>
         <strong>Problem Statement:</strong>
         <p>
            Our engineering scenario involves designing a filtration system to address the issue of antibiotic contamination in hospital wastewater, specifically targeting ciprofloxacin, a persistent 
            and harmful antibiotic found in the wastewater of a rural hospital in Byron Bay, Australia. The primary function of the filter is to effectively remove ciprofloxacin  molecules from the 
            wastewater before it is released into the environment. We aim to design a cost-effective, environmentally sustainable, and low-maintenance system that can handle large volumes of wastewater 
            while considering the rural hospital's limited budget and staffing constraints and the containment size of $5\text-10 \; \mu \text{m}$. High-level objectives include ensuring  the filter is durable, 
            easy to maintain, and capable of preventing the spread of antibiotic-resistant bacteria, ultimately protecting both the environment and the health of the local community.
         </p>
         <strong>Research:</strong>
         <p>
            Research was done to find means of accomplishing the objectives. These means aimed not as much to be realistic but varied, with the goal of capturing the solution space. First, I wrote an executive research 
            summary on the current state of filtration technology fitting to our scenario, and compared with my teammates' research to come up with a morph chart (Fig. 2).
         </p>

         </div>
         <p>
            Afterwards, research was done on numerous real-world concerns regarding the previous researching: potential materials, contaminant/waste standards, electricity standards, optimal placement, and other relevant regulation.
         </p>
         <p>
            Through weighing the cost of benefits of each means carefully, ozonation was judged to be the most sustainable and efficient method of filtration, beating out other methods such as reverse osmosis and UV light.
            I researched potential material acquisition, and it was found that only a whitelist of the Australian Government's allowed materials were permitted for contact with water.
         </p>
         <strong>
            MPIs:
         </strong>
         <p>
            MPIs were derived for the objectives. I was assigned the MPI of minimizing carbon footprint $\text{CO}_2$, while optimizing for yield strength $\sigma$. 
            Using the provided functional constraint for $\sigma_y$, the MPI was derived: 
            $$
            \begin{align*}
            m &= ALP & \sigma_y &> \frac{6FL}{bh^2} \\
            m &= bhlP & \sigma_y &> \frac{6FL}{b(\frac{m}{bLP})^2} \\
            h &= \frac{m}{bLP} & \sigma_y &> \frac{6FL}{\frac{bm^2}{b^2L^2P^2}} \\
            \text{subst}&\text{ituting } h \nearrow & \sigma_y &> \frac{6FLbL^2P^2}{m^2} \\
            && \sigma_y &> \frac{6FL^3bP^2}{m^2} \\
            && m^2 &< \frac{6FL^3bP^2}{\sigma_y} \\
            && m &< \sqrt{6FL^2}\frac{P}{\sqrt{\sigma_y}} \\
            && MPI &= \frac{\sigma_y^{1/2}}{P} = \frac{\sigma_y^{1/2}}{\rho \cdot \text{CO}_2}

            \end{align*}
            $$
         </p>
         <p>
            This MPI along with the two constraints <strong>Freshwater Durability (excellent)</strong>, <strong>Built Environments (rural)</strong>, were used in the materials database Granta EduPack to
            find the optimal materials for the project.

            Upon comparison of my Top 3 matterials with my teammates' materials, a final Top 3 of <strong>coir fiber</strong>, <strong>polypropylene fiber</strong>, and <strong>limestone</strong> was found.
            I researched the suitability of coir fiber, particularly its availability in the area and envrionmental safety. In the end, since polypropylene fiber has strong anti-bacterial properties on its own,
            it was selected as the final material.
         </p>
         <p>
            The number of pores for our material was calculated, then the porosity of the overall fiber, then the effective Young's Modulus and yield strength for the material. Upon examination of polypropylene's
            yield strength (Fig. 4), it satisfied the required yield strength of $154 \; \text{N} / \text{m}^2$.

            Luckily, on the day of the evaluation, when we arrived half an hour earlier for our allotted setup time, the solution worked wonderfully. See Fig. 5 for an image of the full assembled

         <p>
            I feel like I could have done some things better. I think that I was <strong>not proactive enough</strong> during the CAD section of the project. Another group member took it upon themselves to link together
            all of the individual components into an assembly and fix the conflicts and errors that arose, like I did with the code. The group member did not ask the rest of the team for help, but I feel like
            if I had <strong>made my willingness and ability to work with CAD clearer</strong> to the group, the member would have let me help them with the assembling. I potentially could have found and fixed some of the 
            issues that plagued our 3D printing process. That would have led to us having the <strong>testing time</strong> that we missed, which could have given us the ability to <strong>do better</strong>.
         </p>
         <p>
            However, I feel like I learned a lot about the entire pipeline of 3D printing. I familiarized myself with <strong>PrusaSlicer</strong>, the integration of assembly parts in 
            <strong>AutoDesk Inventor</strong>, how to use motion constraints and animate parts, and the creation of <strong>engineering drawings</strong> and <strong>exploded views</strong>.

         <p>
            Additionally, I feel as if I did not sufficiently ask my teammates for feedback. While I posted occasional progress checks and <span class="code-inline">git commit</span>ed my code regularly,
            I think that I should have been in active communication with my team members while doing the major refactoring and linking. I wonder if the code could have been even more compact, even more efficient,
            even more readable had I been coding live with my team?
         </p>
         <p>
            All of my hobby projects have some form of rigor or linkage between files, but not to this level. I learned some new things about Python: while I had casual familiarity with <strong>using Python files as modules</strong>, 
            <strong>reading settings and configuration</strong> from a <span class="code-inline">.py</span> file instead of a <span class="code-inline">.yaml</span> or <span class="code-inline">.json</span> file, and working
            on code with others through <strong>git</strong>, this project was my first time putting these principles into action on a real-world codebase. I feel like I gained a greater appreciation for <strong>source control</strong>, 
            <strong>unit tests</strong>, and <strong>integration tests</strong>. This appreciation was especially evident since I was running and working with code written by others, without guarantees of standardization or proper functionality.

            I have worked on team projects throughout high school, and this project is my first in higher education. I learned how to raise concerns and communicate effectively in official channels, use sharing 
            functions of common workplace tools like <strong>Microsoft 365</strong> (<strong>Sharepoint</strong>, <strong>Teams</strong>, etc), and raise team morale through my interpersonal
            skills (Fig. 6).
