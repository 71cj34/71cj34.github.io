    <h4 style="font-style: italic; color: #979797; margin-top: 0">What we accomplished, what I contributed</h4>
    <p>During this group project, we designed a system to transfer luggage from a platform to another through Autodesk Inventor, while taking in software input on where to place the luggage with Python. 
        We then built and tested a prototype using 3D printing and mechanical actuators.</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>The problem is that a meaningful proportion of luggage at airports is lost in transit. We aim
                        to create a system that delivers bags to their correct locations based on airport regulations.
                        This solution aims to reduce the amount of bags that are lost at airports by using
                        automation.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        
        <div class="img-cont left_img" style="width: 50%">
            <img src="../../../img/fig3-1.png" id="img-swap-0" alt="Image of my design. Large hollow rectangular prism with a ramp inside, below which an adapter houses the tip of the linear actuator, to which is attached a large support with a rotary actuator attachment.">
            <p class="caption"><span class="bold">Fig. 3:</span> My 'bucket' design. Created through three days of iterative development. The 'bucket', attached to linear actuator, rotates using the rotary actuator. </p>
        </div>

        <span class="bold">Brainstorming:</span><br>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #979797; margin-top: 0; font-size: 85%">Oct. 4, 2024 - Oct. 10, 2024</span>
        <p>
            Two initial solutions:
        </p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 0.75em">
            <li>The <span class="bold">'elbow'</span></li>
            <li>The <span class="bold">'bucket'</span></li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The 'bucket' was my idea (Fig. 3, click to switch images); functional design features include:
        </p>

        <ul style="margin-left: 0.75em">
            <li>A smooth ramped bucket for easy delivery</li>
            <li>Weighted base to lower stress on screws</li>
            <li>Hollowed components to lower rotary torque and increase control</li>
            <li>Extended guards for smoother angular movement</li>
        </ul>

        <span class="bold">The Solution:</span><br>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #979797; margin-top: 0; font-size: 85%">Oct. 11, 2024 - Nov. 6, 2024</span>
        <p>
            Ended up with 'elbow' instead, as my design was too complicated to 3D print. More refinements were made, and each member modeled a part. I modeled a support for the rotary actuator. During this 
            time, 3D printing opportunities began: I attended most of these as representatives for our group, printing parts.
        </p>
        <span class="bold">Code:</span><br>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #979797; margin-top: 0; font-size: 85%">Oct. 31, 2024 - Nov. 25, 2024</span>
        <p>
            I was assigned the role of <span class="bold">Software Lead</span>. One function was to be completed by each member; three were to be completed by the team. I completed two of the three team
            functions, and finished my function <span class="code-inline">time_delay.py</span>. I took iterative feedback from the team in this process.
        </p>

        </div>
        <p>
            You can find the full attributed code on GitHub <a href="https://github.com/71cj34/1P13-Project1" target="_blank">here</a>. After the code was finished, I took all modules and executed these steps:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>Collected all Python modules and performed unit tests.</li>
            <li>Standardized all I/O methods.</li>
            <li>Made code readable + added comments.</li>
            <li>Linked modules through an external <span class="code-inline">_config.py</span> file.</li>
            <li>Retrieved and completed the final team function, <span class="code-inline">graphical_teamID.py</span>.</li>
            <li>Linked all modules to one another as inputs.</li>
            <li>Tested and optimized <span class="code-inline">graphical_teamID.py</span>.</li>
            <li>Performed final integration tests for commiting to Github.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            I might even say that I practically rewrote a significant amount of code to fix bugs, solve edge cases and inefficient chunks, and refactored the whole existing base of 
            <span class="code-inline">graphical_teamID.py</span>, since it was outdated.
        </p>
        <span class="bold">Evaluation:</span><br>
        <span style="font-style: italic; color: #979797; margin-top: 0; font-size: 85%">Dec. 2, 2024</span><br>

        <p>
            We finished up our printing and I briefed the team on my changes to their code and final questions on how the code worked. I also assisted on small physical testing of the mechanism.
            We unfortunately suffered <span class="bold">3D printing issues</span> because of slicing errors and improper supports, meaning we had no testing time for the full mechanism.
        </p>
        <p>
            Luckily, on the day of the evaluation, when we arrived half an hour earlier for our allotted setup time, the solution worked wonderfully. See Fig. 5 for an image of the full assembled
            solution on the deployment pad. Tap on the image to toggle extended and retracted forms.

        <span class="bolder" style="text-indent: 0">ON CAD</span>
        <p>
            I feel like I could have done some things better. I think that I was <span class="bold">not proactive enough</span> during the CAD section of the project. Another group member took it upon themselves to link together
            all of the individual components into an assembly and fix the conflicts and errors that arose, like I did with the code. The group member did not ask the rest of the team for help, but I feel like
            if I had <span class="bold">made my willingness and ability to work with CAD clearer</span> to the group, the member would have let me help them with the assembling. I potentially could have found and fixed some of the 
            issues that plagued our 3D printing process. That would have led to us having the <span class="bold">testing time</span> that we missed, which could have given us the ability to <span class="bold">do better</span>.
        </p>
        <p>
            However, I feel like I learned a lot about the entire pipeline of 3D printing. I familiarized myself with <span class="bold">PrusaSlicer</span>, the integration of assembly parts in 
            <span class="bold">AutoDesk Inventor</span>, how to use motion constraints and animate parts, and the creation of <span class="bold">engineering drawings</span> and <span class="bold">exploded views</span>.
        </p>
        <span class="bolder" style="text-indent: 0">ON PYTHON</span>
        <p>
            Additionally, I feel as if I did not sufficiently ask my teammates for feedback. While I posted occasional progress checks and <span class="code-inline">git commit</span>ed my code regularly,
            I think that I should have been in active communication with my team members while doing the major refactoring and linking. I wonder if the code could have been even more compact, even more efficient,
            even more readable had I been coding live with my team?
        </p>
        <p>
            All of my hobby projects have some form of rigor or linkage between files, but not to this level. I learned some new things about Python: while I had casual familiarity with <span class="bold">using Python files as modules</span>, 
            <span class="bold">reading settings and configuration</span> from a <span class="code-inline">.py</span> file instead of a <span class="code-inline">.yaml</span> or <span class="code-inline">.json</span> file, and working
            on code with others through <span class="bold">git</span>, this project was my first time putting these principles into action on a real-world codebase. I feel like I gained a greater appreciation for <span class="bold">source control</span>, 
            <span class="bold">unit tests</span>, and <span class="bold">integration tests</span>. This appreciation was especially evident since I was running and working with code written by others, without guarantees of standardization or proper functionality.
        </p>
        <span class="bolder" style="text-indent: 0">ON PROJECT MANAGEMENT</span>
        <p>
            I have worked on team projects throughout high school, and this project is my first in higher education. I learned how to raise concerns and communicate effectively in official channels, use sharing 
            functions of common workplace tools like <span class="bold">Microsoft 365</span> (<span class="bold">Sharepoint</span>, <span class="bold">Teams</span>, etc), and raise team morale through my interpersonal
            skills (Fig. 6).
